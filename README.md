# Group Scheduler (C++)

A simple command-line based appointment manager written in C++. Users can create appointments, sign up for available slots (max. 4 participants per slot), and withdraw as needed. 
Data is saved in a local CSV file and automatically loaded on startup.

Plan for Future:
GUI (Qt or web-based interface)
Online sync functionality for remote access and team coordination
