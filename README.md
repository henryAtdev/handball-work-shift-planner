The goal of this program is to provide a simple way to organize group appointments, allowing individual users to independently register or cancel 
their appointments for specific times. A maximum of four people are allowed per appointment, and all information is stored clearly in a CSV file.

In the future, an interface and, if necessary, an online function must be implemented.
